# Salva_CSCI2270_FinalProject
In the sport of gymnastics, gymnasts receive scores between 0 and 10 based on how well they completed their routines from a set of judges for each event: floor exercise, balance beam, vault, and uneven bars. The scores can be whole numbers or decimals, causing the difference between two gymnasts' scores to be as small as a hundredth of a point. After an event, going through every gymnast's score to decide who got first, second, and third place for each can be very lenghty. In order to help make this process easier, this program reads in from a file gymnasts' scores, gets the reader input for which event the scores should be analyzed, and outputs who received first, second, and third place along with their scores. The program will store the scores and the other information into a dynamically allocated array.
